1. Basic permissions setup

Set Magento Permissions:
cd <your Magento install dir> 
find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
find . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
find ./var -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;
find ./pub/media -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;
find ./pub/static -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;
chmod 777 ./app/etc
chmod 644 ./app/etc/*.xml

chown -R owner:group . (including the last point dot, sets owner for all files under current Magento 2 installation) - Make sure you replace <owner>:<group> with your current user and the group that it's in. 

chmod u+x bin/magento (add the execute permissions for bin/magento)  

 

2. Advanced permissions setup

The following steps detail how to add your Magento file system owner/user in the web server's group on Apache servers. For other web servers or operating systems, you can use the equivalent commands.

1. Check your <your_username>

whoami
2. Find the web server's user

ps aux | grep apache 
Usually, the apache user is www-data.

3. Find the web server user's group

groups www-data 
Replace www-data with your apache user in case your web server user is different.

Usually, both user and the user's group are www-data.

4. Set the file system owner in the web server group (this needs to be done even if the user is root)

sudo usermod -a -G www-data <your_username>
This is how you add your user to the www-data group.

5. Make sure your user is a member of the web server group

groups <your_username>
The result should be that <your_username> from Step 1 is now part of multiple groups, including www-data, the web server group.

To complete this point, restart the web server:

Ubuntu: 
service apache2 restart
CentOS: 
service httpd restart
6. Set ownership and permissions 

Use <web server group> found at Step 3

cd <to your Magento install directory> 
find var generated vendor pub/static pub/media app/etc -type f -exec chmod g+w {} + 
find var generated vendor pub/static pub/media app/etc -type d -exec chmod g+ws {} +
sudo chown -R <your_username>:<web server group> .       (including the last dot, sets owner for all files under current M2 installation) 
chmod u+x bin/magento                     (add the execute permissions for bin/magento)
